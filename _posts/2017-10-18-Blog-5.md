During this lesson we were doing the final touches to our google sheet , i added salary and pay to my google sheet. I also made it look better and easier to understand which columns do what. During this lesson we had to make a sale sheet in my sale sheet  this showed what items were on sale then. I also extended my stock sheet so that it managed to total u the amount i was spending. Overall this has shown me why we use spreadsheets, how they are helpful and how to use them.
