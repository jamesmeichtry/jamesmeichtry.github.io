During last lesson we did an assessment that we had to answer our opinions the questions that were about racism and calling people gay or rude word. I think that calling someone gay can change if you use it in a polite manner some people use it in a jokey manner to either a person who isn't gay or to someone who is gay. Those people who are gay sometimes take offence. After that we carried on with game.
