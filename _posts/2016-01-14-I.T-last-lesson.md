Today during the last lesson we learnt that in a image or video there is always more than one meaning. for example some images could represent peace or working together most flags mean something like this,but some other flags could mean they have beautiful wildlife or countryside. each video has more than one meaning some videos can have easy meanings but some could have deep confusing meanings.
