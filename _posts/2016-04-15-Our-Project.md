**During last lesson we were looking at our projects and finding out how to make them better and more detailed. For example some people did some weird zooms that didn't fit in with the Prezi. We also looked at how to make the prezi descriptive with pictures and colourful add-ons. We also learnt about how to do good zooms to show the image and the information.   **
