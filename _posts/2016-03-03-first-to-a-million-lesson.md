Last lesson we were talking about what to do if you shared something online that you didn't want to share. Because you were drunk or not thinking responsibly. we watched this video called 'first to a million' it was about to people who were competing to get 1000,000,000 views first. They pulled lots of pranks on eachother but at the end they went too far.  

 One of them got his friend to show some private things to the camera. The other people decided to beat that video by recording his  with his girlfriend doing things. When he posted the video the other people saw and went mental. 

After that we had a look what the consequences were after the recordings, for example looking at websites to help you over getting bullied or abused. 'Think you know' ‘CEOP’.
