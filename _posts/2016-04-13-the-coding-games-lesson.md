**The one thing i learnt about the coding s that you have to be really precise and accurate,if you do one small mistake it will muck up your whole level/game. For example if you do it so your guy steps one place to short you can fail the whole level.**

**If you make one small mistake you will end up failing. If you do two jumps instead of one or you do one to many steps.**
