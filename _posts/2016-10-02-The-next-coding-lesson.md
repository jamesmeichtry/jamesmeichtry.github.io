    We need to speed up a bit more, We also need to precise when writing the code because we would make the mistake of putting a capital letter at the start of a letter that should not have a capital, we also did not put the capital letter at the start when we needed to.</th>

    <th>I will make sure I read the text properly before  I write it out and start the program or that could cause a big mistake that could cause a long time to repair and get my piece of work running again. I will also work as quick as I can whilst helping the group in anyway even if that is just reading out the code.</th>
