During this lesson we created different discount codes and we spent the whole lesson trying to find out how to find out how much you have to take of. During the lesson we had to use perseverance because we had a lot less help this less because we had to use our own previous knowledge and use are common sense to work out the answer. We had to find out the discount code using vlookup. I then found out what that percentage is compared to the actual price. We had to make it minus by taking what you get from zero that will turn it into minus numbers. This made the discount code into actual money and not a percentage. I then subtracted the minus number from the total.
