During this lesson we were introduced ed to google sheets and learned the basics like adding the columns or rows together, using  =add c3, e4. I also learnt how to count ( count the amount of rows or columns). I learnt the basics and we had to make a basic first sheet with numbers, that multiplied and added together. We also made a order and stock sheet and order form. In the order form we used codes, and items with prices. On the stork form we looked at the prices and selling prices and profit. We also had a look at quantity and quantity in stock for the order form and stock sheet. We also had to add colour to it to make it look cool and to give people an idea of what the more important information is and where.
