During last lesson we learnt the good and bad things about social media. For example you might be able to talk to new people but the bad thing about that is that the people you are talking to may not actually be who they say they are and could be lying to manipulating you to do something or share something you would not normally share. Overall social media is good if you know how to use it safely and effectively
