In this lesson we carried on with the spreadsheet we also used ranges to sort out our stock, this would help in real life because if the stock was low it would tell you to order more. But if there was too many you could do a deal and could lower the price, to sell more. We also used profit target which raised the selling price by a percentage that can be changed to change the amount of profit. We used vlookup to use the stock sheet and convert the prices onto the order forms. We used the codes from the stock sheet and then you type a code in and it comes up with the price. Overall in the lessons i had to use resourcefulness especially in the vllookup because i got that bit wrong multiple times.
