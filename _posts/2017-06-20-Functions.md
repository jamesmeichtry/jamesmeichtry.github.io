During this lesson i learnt more about the if elif and else statements. I also learned how to maximise or make words smaller. Maximise make any word larger than other words. The minimise does the opposite. We also learnt how to add modules. A module is a bit of code that contains variables, strings and functions that you can use once it is in your code. The type() function returns the type of the data it has as an argument. The abs() function returns the 'absolute value' of the number it takes as an argument, the number's distance from 0 on an imaginary number line. For example, 3 and -3 both have the same ‘absolute value’: 3. The abs() bit of code will always return  positive  unlike max() and min().
