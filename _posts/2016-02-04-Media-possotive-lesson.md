During last lesson we learnt that social media can help you and be dangerous at the same time but if you use it correctly it will be fine.

 

We had a look at some examples and had to sort them out bad to worse:

* one of our worst ones was that 'If you post that you are going on holiday to somewhere',we thought this one was bad because the people who sore that message could if they know where you live burgal you or damage your propety.

* Are best one was 'sharing a funny picture of a cat/animal', we put this one this low because there is no personal information and thereâ€™s nothing dangerous about it.
