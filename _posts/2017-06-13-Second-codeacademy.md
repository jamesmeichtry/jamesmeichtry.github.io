After a break from code academy we went back to code academy I learned how to use a true or false to make a expression different using **<> . **This was much harder than the last time I used them. I also had to complete the Big if this was much harder than anything else I had done. I had to include an if, elif and else statement I also had to have an true or false equation in the. You also had to change the statements to true or False and then put it back to false again. But the bit I found hardest was laying it out in the right order so that the code worked you had to have the if stamens when space across so the rest of the world if stamens would happen and the the Leif statement would happen.
