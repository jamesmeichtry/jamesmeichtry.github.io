This lesson i am using more lists and list slicing. I have to slice up lists so i only have a certain section. When i add to add and remove animals i found it really hard, but i used trial and error to gradually get closer and closer to the answer. I also had to multiply a list by 2.  After that i learned about using dictionaries to change the name of a list or a part of a list. I also had to add indexes into my code and manage to add inserts to add or remove things from lists. Overall i think that i improved a lot and i managed to get a lot of work done throughout using python and adapted in many ways.
