During the last lesson i learnt that coding is very precise and if you do one small mistake it will mess up all the other coding. to stop these mistakes you can have a look in your repository settings or have a look at the coding and see if the changes you make looks like all the other original coding (the colours are the same so all writing on the left is the same colour all the writing on the right needs to be the same as well, there should be no plain writing). There's a space after the colon). 

If you have added two new pieces of code and you don't know which ones wrong either delete one and check if it works. Then add that one and delete the other. If both of them fail have a look at your history to have a look when your repository stopped working.
