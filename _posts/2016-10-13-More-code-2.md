    <td>My strategies were trial and error so if something did not work than i would try again to fix it. I also had to use my own common sense not to make any silly mistakes like not putting a capital were needed.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson me and my group did not do as much work as normal, this could be because we were just finishing the conversations and they were getting quite complex and large. I also think that collaborating as a group always helps to be fast and we were not as organised and were not collaborating as well as usual.</td>

    <td>Me and my group will try to be organised and work fast together i will also use my common sense and initiative to work out some things that are not as obvious and are discrete for example if you put a space where it should not be than the computer will not understand the code because it will be out of place.</td>
