In this week's lesson are started to learn how to make certain statements true or false if you make them not false it will make the true and if you made them not true they would become not true. You could do this for equations for example, **4 > 7 = false** or **4 > 7 = not true. **For this bit of work I had to use previous knowledge because I did the equations last lesson so if I had forgot what i did last lesson it would be very hard especially if I did not do what are learned last lesson to explore with my answers and to not jump to conclusions.

Overall next lesson I am going use my previous knowledge and try to work as fast as possible. I will also try to challenge myself by going with more complex answers.
