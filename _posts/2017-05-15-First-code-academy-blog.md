During this first lesson I started to use python and I first learnt about strings and how to use strings and then I learnt about making the strings uppercase and then lower case. These helped me learn about trial and error because you had to keep the letters all lower case and sometimes I did not do that this will also help me in the future because I know that strings are big parts in the coding to come. 

I also learnt about how to do dates and about using the % to do that the date and time could be swapped around so it would be time and date. This helped me resolve the Big problems because it was hard and you had to do more than one attempt.

I earned two medals one for Changing the time the other for doing 25 exercises
