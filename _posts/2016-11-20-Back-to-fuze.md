    <td>I had to use my own common sense not to make any silly mistakes like not putting a space in between speech marks were needed. We also had to work together, one person reading the book to the person who is  typing and then you swap round. </td>

    <td>This lesson me and my group did not do as much work as normal, this could be because we are now looking at quite complex and large . I also think that working together as a group always helps to be fast and we were not as organised as usual.</td>

    <td>our group will try to be organised and work fast together i will also use my common sense and try to solve the big problems as fast as i can. I should put a space where it should be. If we are organised we will complete more exercises and we will learn much more.</td>
