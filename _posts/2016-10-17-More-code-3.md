    <td>working fast as a group helped me to do all of the 3 exercises. To work well as a group we gave each other a job so we new who was doing what, we swapped over every ten minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on checking through my work checking if a colour comes up to say it knows the code. We also did not talk a lot this lesson which was good.
If I check for my mistakes every line then the mistakes might not get worse as the code goes on.</td>

    <td>Me and my group will try to be organised and work fast together, we will also be accurate so we do not make silly mistakes because the person saying the code said it wrong. I will make sure i try to change the code to make it better for example changing the colours.  </td>
