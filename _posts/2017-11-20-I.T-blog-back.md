On this first lesson back we started learning about cypher, cypher is when you make something that will make a coded message that has letters that are a certain amount ahead of its usual letters. For this we used vlookup, if and iserror. I think that in the future we will also use left and right. Cypher would be useful to send messages that you do not want people to see. This lesson we started by making an alphabet and then a translator that looked up a letter in a vlookup.
