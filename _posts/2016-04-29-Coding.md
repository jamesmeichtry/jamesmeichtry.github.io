During last lesson we learnt how to code using microbit,it was quite hard at the start but when i got used to it was pretty easy. We had to code a random hat like sixth one from Harry Potter. We had to get it to randomise and then choose a random number from one to six, after that we had to say that if 1 is picked then 1= A house.
