**If it wasn't for the six lessons my identity map would have been a lot different because i have learnt many things, like: How to use social media safely and efficiently. Those lessons have really changed my perspective of social media. I found making my identity map quite fun because the task was creative. I think my map went well and i was fine to share it with the class because it wasn't to personal.**

**Commenting on the identity maps was pretty easy because you can tell when they try and do something could and creative but you can also tell when they just weren't bothered. All the comments on my work were almost all the same. The identity map helped me realise that social media is not just to share some pictures it can also help you get a job.**
