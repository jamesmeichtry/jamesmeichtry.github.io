**E-safety**

**During last lesson we learnt about how important it is to stay safe on the computer. First we had to make sure we don't show too many personal details (like where you live or how old you are).**

**we also learned to only communicate with people you know because you do not know who they are or how old they are.**

**We also had to remember that not all people are really who they say they are and they could be manipulating you to give them money or personal items.**
