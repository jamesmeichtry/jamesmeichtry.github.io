**E-safety**

**During last lesson we learnt about how important it is to stay safe. First we had to make sure we don't show too many personal details (like where you live).**

**we also learned to only communicate with people you know because you know who they are  old they are.**

**We also had to remember that not all people are really who they say they are and they could be manipulating you.**
