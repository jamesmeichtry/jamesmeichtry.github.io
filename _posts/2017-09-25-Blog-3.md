During this lesson we learnt to add discounts and hot to add a discount code, we learnt that we had to shorten the codes to the first 2 letters so that it is easier to sort out. We used =left(a4, 2) the 2 shows how many numbers we are keeping from the left. I then used those codes that were made. I made 3 different discounts for 3 different codes. They were 10%, 15% and 20%. I then used the discount code and took that away from the total, all of this took a while because i had to do when command to sort out what the discount was and how much i was discounting off from the subtotal. I used trial and error because i did the if command wrong quite a few times and then had to check over it.
