In pyglatin you have to change the word through, for example i made it lower case and if the word was something it would print something else. For pyglatin i am trying to make a machine that automatically swaps a word round and makes. In pyglatin i have to use what i learnt in previous exercises specially in the more complex exercises. 

After that i started functions this is when you add a word onto something to explain the function. You would put define and then what you are going to define on the line below. I did not have to use previous knowledge in the first bit of functions but i am sure i will hate to in the harder exercises.
