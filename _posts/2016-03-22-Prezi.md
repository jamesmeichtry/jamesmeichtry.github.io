**During last lesson we learnt about a new presentation software called prezi:**

* **Prezi can help you in you presentation to just give your audience that bit more detail.**

* **It can also help you expand on your point.**

* **It can help the audience by adding a picture that your words can not do.**

**Downsides**

**During a presentation of prezi your audience can start to feel ill because of all the movements.**

**If you are not careful, you may have to start again because there is a maximum zoom point so you may not be able to do a special finishing zoom/slide.**

**Features **

**There are many features in Prezi such as:**

* **Being able to add effects to pictures such as adding different lighting and a different frame.**

* **You can also have a movement that is cool and will shock the reader.**
