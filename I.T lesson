### **during the previous lessons we have coded our websites this is how i did mine:**

* **first you have to fork a jekyll.**

* **then you have to change the name of the website by going into settings. you change your website name to   yourgithubusername.github.io this will make your repository online.**

* **then you can change the coding in these two files  _config.yml and style.sccs this will change the looks of your website.**

* **If you want to add a post you have to first download gabriel. then you create a document on google docs. then you go to add-ons then you press on gabriel, then you start publishing. make sure to edit  type and extra  YAML to _posts**
